From game design references, interesting shader tricks, and articles worth reading, to more in-depth thoughts and opinions

---

## A short preface

I think a lot of you out there are familiar with the feeling of finding something cool, interesting or just neat that you want to share with others. You drop it to your friends on Discord, tweet about it, maybe even save somewhere and move on.

If its big enough or fits some kind of public knowledge collection you already have - you might even put it there.

But what do you do when you encounter something you think is cool, but it's too small to preserve. But then a year down the line you find yourself searching through your Discord logs across hundreds of servers and thousands of channels, wishing you would save it somewhere.

Some time ago I started to save things like that to my Raindrop collection syncing into Obsidian, the note taking app I use. But that is also private, and not all the things I'd love to share are on the internet to begin with.

So this is where "Items of Interest" come in. A series of posts (or a newsletter, subscribe below!) that will, hopefully, come out with some level of regularity. Where I'll post things I find interesting. From game design references, interesting shader tricks, and articles worth reading, to more in-depth thoughts on something I encountered. Like a service, tool or a product. Oh and yeah, not everything will be super recent, as sometimes I find things from a while ago I haven't seen people talking about.

_wow, this almost sounds like a blog..._

With that out of the way, let's start with the very first issue of orels' Items of Interest, Christmas 2023 Edition ðŸŽ„

## VR Lockpicking in AC: Nexus

#game-design #reference #vr

I love some great-feeling VR game mechanics and I think the lockpicking from Assassin's Creed: Nexus.

I think the reason why it feels satisfying is the nice feeling of two-handed control. Where the left hand controls the "depth" of picking, and the right - the rotation. The depth also has a nice easing that feels like it "snaps" to a level as you push and pull.
